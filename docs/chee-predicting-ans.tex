\section{Introduction}
\Cyclus \cite{carlsen_cyclus_2014}, a nuclear fuel cycle simulator, was used to simulate the
United States' nuclear fuel cycle from 1968 through 2013. The
\gls{SNF} inventory from the \Cyclus simulation was compared to the \gls{SNF} 
inventory from the \gls{DOE} sponsored \gls{UNFSTANDARDS} \gls{UDB} 
\cite{peterson_unf-st&dards_2017}. The \gls{UDB} provides comprehensive and 
consistent technical data on reactor sites and \gls{SNF} from the beginning of 
nuclear reactor operation in the \gls{US} until 2013. This comparison 
between \Cyclus and \gls{UDB} establishes a realistic validation of \Cyclus' 
capability to produce spent fuel mass and isotopic compositions 
that closely match reality.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Motivation}
The \gls{US} is currently considering various geologic disposal 
options \cite{DOE_strategy_2013}. Decisions such as waste package spacing, 
waste repository geometry and size will be influenced by key criteria such as 
thermal load of waste packages and the thermal capacity of the selected 
geologic host media. Waste package thermal evolution depends on the decay heat 
contribution from each isotope in the spent fuel. Therefore, to correctly 
simulate loading of a nuclear waste repository based on thermal constraints in \Cyclus, 
the simulation must first give isotopic compositions and spent fuel masses that 
closely replicate reality.

\section{Background}
\Cyclus is an agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework 
\cite{huff_fundamental_2016}, which means that each entity (i.e. Region, 
Institution, or Facility) in the fuel cycle is modeled as an agent. 
\Cycamore \cite{carlsen_cycamore_2014} provides agents to represent process 
physics of various components of the nuclear fuel cycle (e.g. mine, fuel 
enrichment facility, reactor) \cite{huff_extensions_2014}. The nuclear fuel 
assemblies tracked within the simulation are recipe-based; recipes specify mass 
fractions of each isotope for fresh and spent fuel. They are calculated ahead 
of time using neutronics depletion analysis tools such as ORIGEN 
\cite{bell_origen_1973}, then entered directly into the fuel cycle simulation 
\cite{peterson_additional_2017}. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methodology}
Published data of the 112 commercial nuclear reactors that have operated since 
1968 was used to create a \Cyclus simulation of the \gls{US} 
nuclear fuel cycle. The reactor deployment data was obtained from the \gls{PRIS} 
database \cite{IAEA_pris_2017}.  Relevant data includes 
reactor unit, reactor type, net capacity (MWe), first grid date, and shutdown 
date. \gls{US}' reactor data was extracted and used to populate the \Cyclus 
simulation. The recipes used in the \Cyclus simulations are taken from a 
reference depletion calculation done using ORIGEN \cite{bell_origen_1973} for 
burnups of 51 and 33 GWD/MTU. They were also used in 
\cite{wilson_adoption_2009, bae_synergistic_2017}. 

Jinja2 \cite{ronacher_welcome_2018}, a Python templating language, was then 
used to render the data into an input file that is accepted by 
\Cyclus. The output file produced by \Cyclus was also analyzed using Python. 

The assumptions made for this \Cyclus simulation include: 

\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
	\item Cycle time is 18 months. 
	\item Refueling time is 1 month. 
	\item There is isotopic decay. 
\end{enumerate}

The \gls{UDB} database contains commercial \gls{SNF} information from 1968 through 2013. 
Data such as initial enrichment, burnup, mass of spent fuel and discharged 
dates were collected from multiple sources \cite{peterson_additional_2017}. 
Irradiation and decay calculations were performed on each spent fuel assembly based on their parameters
in the collected data \cite{peterson_additional_2017}.

The \gls{UDB} dataset used for this work included discharged fuel assembly data per 
reactor, specific isotopic concentrations and decay heat for each assembly 
along with its discharge date \cite{peterson_unf-st&dards_2017}. The \gls{UDB} 
dataset was processed and compared with the \Cyclus 
simulations' outputs. All scripts and data used are available in a public github repository
\cite{chee_arfc/transition-scenarios_2018}. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results and Analysis}
The primary goal of this study is to provide comparisons between 
\Cyclus data and \gls{UDB} data for spent fuel mass and isotopic contributions to the 
spent fuel mass. 

\subsection{\textit{Cumulative Spent Fuel Mass Comparison}}
To investigate the accuracy of \Cyclus, a comparison between the cumulative spent fuel mass 
predicted by \Cyclus and calculated in \gls{UDB} was conducted. As seen in figure \ref{fig:total_original}, the cumulative spent fuel mass estimated by \Cyclus is larger than the \gls{UDB} calculation before the year 2000; after 2000, the \gls{UDB} calculation reports a larger cumulative spent fuel mass. The discrepancies can be attributed to the rigidity of the \Cyclus simulation input with respect to cycle and 
refueling durations. In \Cyclus, the user specifies refueling and cycle times for each 
reactor as constant integer months.  In reality, the cycle and refueling durations 
vary throughout each reactor's lifetime and are not exact integer multiples of one month.

\end{figure}

	\caption{The cumulative spent fuel mass against discharge time for \Cyclus and \gls{UDB} data from 1968 through 2013 for various refueling durations.}
	\label{fig:total_refueltime}
\end{figure} 

The \gls{NEI} reported significant variance in the refueling duration for \gls{US} reactors. Average 
refueling duration in 1990 was 104 days and decreased to an average of 35 days in 2017 \cite{iaea_current_nodate}. In the \Cyclus simulations, a constant refueling duration of 1 month was 
used. Therefore, to investigate if the refueling duration could explain the spent fuel mass discrepancy in figure \ref{fig:total_original}, \Cyclus simulations were run with different refueling durations.
Figure \ref{fig:total_refueltime} shows the cumulative spent fuel mass from \Cyclus simulations where 
the refueling duration was varied. A longer refueling duration brings the cumulative spent fuel mass 
from \Cyclus simulations closer to the \gls{UDB} data before 2000.

	\label{fig:total_cycletime}
\end{figure} 

The larger cumulative \gls{UDB} spent fuel mass compared to the \Cyclus simulation 
after 2000 can be attributed to real world cycle lengths being shorter on 
average than the 18 month cycle time assumed in the \Cyclus simulations. 
Figure \ref{fig:total_cycletime} shows the cumulative spent fuel mass from 
\Cyclus simulations where cycle duration is varied. A shorter cycle duration brings the 
cumulative spent fuel mass from \Cyclus simulations closer to the \gls{UDB} data after 
2000. The \gls{US} \gls{DOE} reported a downward trend of forced outage 
rates for nuclear reactors from 4.24\%  in 2000 to 2.98\% in 2014 \cite{gehin_nuclear_2016}. 
The decreased rate of forced outages from 2000 to 2013 implies that the cycle duration also 
decreased. 

\subsection{\textit{Major Isotopic Composition of  Spent Fuel Mass Comparison}}
To accurately simulate the U.S. nuclear fuel cycle from 1968 through the present, 
it is important to use spent fuel recipes that have similar burnup in relation to 
the average U.S. nuclear reactor burnup. 

Figure \ref{fig:burn_up_real} shows the average cumulative burnup for U.S. 
nuclear reactors from 1968 to 2013 \cite{eia_spent_2015}. Figure 
\ref{fig:burn_up_difference} shows the difference between burnup of the spent 
fuel recipes used in the \Cyclus simulations and actual cumulative burnup of U.S. 
nuclear reactors as seen in figure \ref{fig:burn_up_real}. On average, spent 
fuel burnup of 33 GWD/MTU is closer to the actual cumulative burnup of U.S. nuclear 
reactors than 51 GWD/MTU.

	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/burn_up_real}
	\caption{The average cumulative burnup for U.S. nuclear reactors from 1968 to 2013 \cite{eia_spent_2015}.}

	\caption{The difference between average cumulative burnup for U.S. nuclear reactors and burnup used in \Cyclus simulations.}
	\label{fig:burn_up_difference}
\end{figure} 

Figures \ref{fig:absolute_diff_all_51} and \ref{fig:absolute_diff_all_33} show 
the cumulative spent fuel isotopic mass difference between \gls{UDB} and \Cyclus data 
in 5 year intervals for burnup rates of 51 GWD/MTU and 33 GWD/MTU correspondingly. 
The \Cyclus data that had 33 GWD/MTU burnup deviated less compared to the 
\Cyclus data that had 51 GWD/MTU burnup. This is apparent for $^{236}$U, 
$^{242}$Pu and $^{240}$Pu. However, they are similar for the isotopes on the left side 
of both figures, with an exception of $^{239}$Pu that deviated more for the \Cyclus data that 
had 33 GWD/MTU burnup.

To demonstrate the impact of burnup on isotopic composition, the cumulative 
spent fuel isotopic mass difference between \gls{UDB} and \Cyclus data for 
the year 2000 is shown in figure \ref{fig:absolute_diff_2000}. In 2000, the difference in 
burnup between the actual U.S. reactor burnups and \Cyclus data burnup was 
approximately 20 GWD/MTU for 51 GWD/MTU burnup and 0 GWD/MTU for 33 GWD/MTU burnup 
(figure \ref{fig:burn_up_difference}), therefore, the impact of burnup on isotopic 
composition can be seen more clearly since one \Cyclus simulation has the same burnup as the 
actual U.S nuclear reactors burnup. 

Wigeland et al \cite{wigeland_separations_2006} discussed that $^{240}$Pu, 
$^{239}$Pu and $^{241}$Am are the most significant long-term decay heat 
contributors to each waste package, while, $^{238}$Pu, $^{244}$Cm, $^{90}$Sr 
and $^{137}$Cs are the most significant short term decay heat contributors 
\cite{wigeland_separations_2006}. 

In figure \ref{fig:absolute_diff_2000}, the \Cyclus simulation that uses the 33 
GWD/MTU burnup recipe has a small mass difference between \gls{UDB} and \Cyclus data 
for $^{240}$Pu and $^{241}$Am compared to 51 GWD/MTU burnup. However, it has a 
substantial difference for $^{239}$Pu. Figure 4 also shows small differences 
between \gls{UDB} and \Cyclus data for $^{238}$Pu, $^{244}$Cm, $^{90}$Sr and 
$^{137}$Cs. 

The large mass difference between \gls{UDB} and \Cyclus data (where \gls{UDB} $^{239}$Pu 
mass is larger than \Cyclus $^{239}$Pu mass) for $^{239}$Pu in figures 
\ref{fig:absolute_diff_2000}, \ref{fig:absolute_diff_all_51} and 
\ref{fig:absolute_diff_all_33} can be attributed to conservative depletion 
parameters used in the calculations for isotopic compositions in the \gls{UDB} 
database \cite{peterson_additional_2017}. These assumptions result in the 
hardening of the neutron spectrum that results in increased $^{239}$Pu 
production in the \gls{UDB} data \cite{peterson_additional_2017}.

\section{Conclusions}
This work demonstrates that the spent fuel mass and isotopic composition 
calculated by the \Cyclus simulation for the \gls{US} nuclear fuel cycle 
follow similar trends as the real world metrics. Deviations from the real world metric 
can be explained by issues with the \Cyclus model, such as the reactor agent's rigidity 
of only accepting integer month values for cycle and refueling durations, and a single 
spent fuel recipe. To replicate reality more closely, future work 
will give the reactor agent the capability to accept varying cycle lengths, refueling 
durations and spent fuel recipes.
