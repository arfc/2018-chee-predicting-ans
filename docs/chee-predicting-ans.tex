\section{Introduction}
\Cyclus \cite{carlsen_cyclus_2014}, a fuel cycle simulator, was used to simulate the
United States' nuclear fuel cycle from 1967 through 2013. The spent nuclear fuel (SNF) inventory from the \Cyclus simulation was compared to SNF inventory from the U.S Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored Unified Database (UDB) \cite{peterson_unf-st&dards_2017}. The UDB provides comprehensive and consistent technical data on reactor sites and spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from the beginning of nuclear reactor operation in the United States until 2013. This comparison between \Cyclus and UDB establishes a realistic validation of \Cyclus capabilities to produce accurate isotopic compositions and total spent fuel mass that closely match reality.

\section{Background}
\Cyclus is an agent-based fuel cycle simulation framework \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}, which means that each facility in the fuel cycle is modeled as an agent. \Cycamore \cite{carlsen_cycamore_2014} provides agents to represent process physics of various components of the nuclear fuel cycle (e.g. mine, fuel enrichment facility, reactor) \cite{huff_extensions_2014}. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Motivation}
The United States is currently considering various fuel cycles and geologic disposal options
\cite{DOE_strategy_2013}. Decisions such as waste package spacing, waste repository size and geometry will be influenced by key criteria such as thermal load of waste packages and the thermal capacity of the selected geologic host media. Waste package thermal evolution depends on the decay heat contribution from each isotope in the spent fuel. Therefore, to correctly simulate loading of a waste repository based on thermal constraints in \Cyclus, the simulation must first give isotopic compositions and spent fuel masses that closely replicate reality. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methodology}
\subsection{\textit{Generating \Cyclus Simulation and Analysis}}
A \Cyclus simulation of the United States nuclear fuel cycle was created using published data of the 112 commerical nuclear reactors that have operated since 1967 in the United States. The reactor deployment data was obtained from the Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) reactor database \cite{IAEA_pris_2017}. The relevant data included the: country, reactor unit, type, net capacity (MWe), first grid date and shutdown date. Data for reactors in the United States were extracted and used to populate the simulation. The nuclear fuel assemblies tracked within the simulation are recipe-based. Recipes specify mass fractions for each isotope for fresh and spent fuel. They are calculated ahead of time using neutronics depletion analysis tools such as ORIGEN \cite{bell_origen_1973}, then entered directly into the fuel cycle simulation. The recipes used in this \Cyclus simulation are taken from a reference depletion calculation done using ORIGEN \cite{bell_origen_1973} for burnups of 51 and 33 GWDt/MTU. They were also used in \cite{wilson_adoption_2009, bae_synergistic_2017}. 

Jinja2 \cite{ronacher_welcome_2018}, a Python templating language, was then used in Python to render the data into an input file that can be accepted by \Cyclus. The output file produced by \Cyclus was also analyzed using Python. 

The assumptions made for this \Cyclus simulation include: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Cycle time is assumed to be 18 months. 
	\item Refuel time is assumed to be 1 month. 
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{\textit{UDB Data Analysis}}
The UDB data contained SNF information from 1967 up to 2013. The dataset includes discharged fuel assembly data per reactor, specific isotopic concentrations and decay heat for each assembly along with its discharge date \cite{peterson_unf-st&dards_2017}. The UDB dataset was imported into Python and processed to be compared with \Cyclus simulation output. All scripts and data used are available in \cite{chee_arfc/transition-scenarios_2018}. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results and Analysis}
The primary outcome of this validation is to provide comparisons between \Cyclus and UDB for spent fuel mass and major isotopic contributions to the total spent fuel mass. 

\subsection{\textit{Cumulative Total Spent Fuel Mass Comparison}}
Figure \ref{fig:total_original} shows the cumulative spent fuel mass for both \Cyclus and UDB data from 1967 to 2013. The total spent fuel mass estimated by \Cyclus is larger than UDB data before the year 2000 and diverges after, with UDB being larger. The discrepancies can be attributed to rigidity of \Cyclus simulation input with respect to cycle and refuel time. In \Cyclus, the user specifies refuel and cycle times for each reactor as constant integer months. In reality, the cycle and refuel times vary throughout each reactor's lifetime and are not exact integer multiples of one month.

	\caption{Total cumulative spent fuel mass against discharge time for \Cyclus and UDB data from 1967 up to 2013.}
	\label{fig:total_original}
\end{figure}

The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) reported that there has been significant variance in the refueling period for reactors in the United States. The average refuelling time in 1990 was 104 days, and generally decreased to an average refuelling time of 35 days in 2017 \cite{iaea_current_nodate}.

Figure \ref{fig:total_refueltime} includes plots of total spent fuel mass from \Cyclus simulations where refuel time is increased. A longer refuel time brings the total spent fuel mass from \Cyclus simulations closer to the UDB data before 2000.

	\caption{Total cumulative spent fuel mass against discharge time for \Cyclus and UDB data from 1967 up to 2013 for varying refuel time}
	\label{fig:total_refueltime}
\end{figure} 

The larger cumulative UDB spent fuel mass compared to the \Cyclus simulation after 2000 can be attributed to the real world cycle lengths being shorter than the 18 month length of \Cyclus simulations. The United States DOE reported that there was a downward trend of forced outage rates of nuclear reactors from 2000 to 2014. The forced outage rate was 4.24\% in 2000 and 2.98\% in 2013 \cite{gehin_nuclear_2016}. As the rate of forced outages decreased from 2000 to 2013, the cycle length also decreased. 

Figure \ref{fig:total_cycletime} includes plots of total spent fuel mass from \Cyclus simulations where cycle time is varied. A shorter cycle time brings the total spent fuel mass from \Cyclus simulations closer to the UDB data after 2000.

\end{figure} 

\subsection{\textit{Major Isotopic Composition of  Spent Fuel Mass Comparison}}
For an accurate simulation of the U.S. nuclear fuel cycle from 1968 till the present, it important to use appropriate spent fuel recipes that have similar burn up in relation to the U.S. average cumulative nuclear reactor burn up. 

Figure \ref{fig:burn_up_real}  shows the average cumulative burn up for U.S. nuclear reactors from 1968 to 2013[table]. Figure \ref{fig::burn_up_difference} shows the difference between burnup of the spent fuel recipes used and cumulative burnup from real world data [table] from figure \ref{fig:burn_up_real}. As a whole, spent fuel burnup of 33 GWDt/MTU is closer to the real world U.S. burnup reactor data than 51 GWDt/MTU. 

\begin{figure}[h] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{burn_up_real}
	\caption{Average cumulative burnup for U.S. nuclear reactors from 1968 to 2013 [table]}
	\label{fig:burn_up_real}
\end{figure} 

\begin{figure}[h] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{burn_up_difference}
	\caption{Difference in average cumulative burn up in real world and \Cyclus simulation}
	\label{fig:burn_up_difference}
\end{figure} 

Figures \ref{fig:absolute_diff_all_51} and \ref{fig:absolute_diff_all_33} show the decayed cumulative spent fuel isotopic mass difference between UDB and Cyclus data in 5 year intervals for burnup of 51 GWDt/MTU and 33 GWDt/MTU correspondingly. The Cyclus data deviates less for the 33 GWDt/MTU burn up recipe Cyclus simulation compared to 51 GWDt/MTU. This is apparent for U-236, Pu-242 and Pu-240. However, the cyclus data for the 33 GWDt/MTU burn up recipe Cyclus simulation compared to 51 GWDt/MTU is similar for the isotopes on the left side of both figures. With an exception of Pu-239 having a substantial larger absolute error for 33 GWDt/MTU than 51 GWDt/MTU. 

\begin{figure}[h] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{absolute_diff_all_51}
	\caption{Absolute difference between spent fuel mass from UDB data and \Cyclus data for each isotope for burnup of 51 GWd/MTU (Positive difference means \Cyclus data is larger and negative difference means UDB data is larger)}
	\label{fig:absolute_diff_all_51}
\end{figure} 

\begin{figure}[h] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{absolute_diff_all_33}
	\caption{Absolute difference between spent fuel mass from UDB data and \Cyclus data for each isotope for burnup of 33 GWd/MTU (Positive difference means \Cyclus data is larger and negative difference means UDB data is larger)}
	\label{fig:absolute_diff_all_33}
\end{figure} 

The impact of burnup on isotopic composition can be seen more clearly by looking at the decayed cumulative spent fuel isotopic mass difference between UDB and Cyclus data for the year 2000. In figure \ref{fig:burn_up_real}, at year 2000, the real world cumulative average U.S. nuclear reactor burn up was very close to 33 GWDt/MTU. Therefore, the difference in burn up between the real world cumulative average U.S. nuclear reactor burn up and cyclus data burn up was around 20 GWDt/MTU for 51 GWd/MTU and 0 GWDt/MTU for 33 GWd/MTU (as seen in figure \ref{fig:burn_up_difference}). 

Wigeland et al [cite] states that $^{240}$Pu, $^{239}$Pu and $^{241}$Am are the most significant long-term decay heat contributors. While, $^{238}$Pu, $^{244}$Cm, $^{90}$Sr and $^{137}$Cs are significant short term decay heat contributors. 

In figure \ref{fig:absolute_diff_2000}, the Cyclus simulation that uses 33 GWd/MTU burn up recipe has a small mass difference between UDB and Cyclus data for $^{240}$Pu and $^{241}$Am. However, it has a substantial difference for $^{239}$Pu. Figure 4 also shows small differences between UDB and Cyclus data for $^{238}$Pu, $^{244}$Cm, $^{90}$Sr and $^{137}$Cs. 

\begin{figure}[h] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{absolute_diff_2000}
	\caption{Absolute difference between spent fuel mass from UDB data and \Cyclus data for each isotope at year 2000 for burnup of 33 GWd/MTU and 51 GWd/MTU (Positive difference means \Cyclus data is larger and negative difference means UDB data is larger)}
	\label{fig:absolute_diff_2000}
\end{figure} 

The large difference between UDB and \Cyclus data (where UDB > \Cyclus) for $^{239}$Pu in figures \ref{fig:absolute_diff_2000}, \ref{fig:absolute_diff_all_51} and \ref{fig:absolute_diff_all_33} can be attributed to conservative depletion parameters used in the calculations for isotopic compositions in the UDB database \cite{peterson_additional_2017}. These assumptions result in the hardening of the neutron spectrum that results in increased $^{239}$Pu production \cite{peterson_additional_2017}.

\section{Conclusions}
This work demonstrates that the spent fuel mass and isotopic composition results from the \Cyclus simulation of the United States nuclear fuel cycle closely follow the results from real world metrics. This proves that these results can be used to produce accurate isotopic decay heat contributions and simulate loading of a waste repository based on thermal constraints. However, improvements can be made to more closely replicate reality.  

Further work that can improve the simulation is to give the reactor agent the capability to accept varying cycle lengths, refuel lengths and spent fuel recipes. Therefore, by looking at the historic United States reactor operating data, a \Cyclus simulation can be made to replicate their cycle and refuel times even more closely. Also, spent fuel recipes that closely match the burn up for each reactor cycle can be used. This would give more accurate spent fuel mass and isotopic compositions which will in turn make the simulations for loading of a waste repository more accurate.
