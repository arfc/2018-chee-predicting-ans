\section{Introduction}
\Cyclus \cite{huff_fundamentals_2016}, a fuel cycle simulator, was used to run a simulation of the
United States' historic nuclear fuel cycle. Validation was performed for the resulting isotopic
concentration of spent fuel with respect to spent nuclear fuel (SNF) data from the U.S Department of
Energy (DOE) sponsored Unified Database (UDB) \cite{Peterson_UNF_2017}.  UDB provides
comprehensive and consistent technical data on reactor sites and spent nuclear fuel (SNF) up to the
year 2013.

The cumulative mass of spent nuclear fuel and major isotopes were compared. Comparison of the
\Cyclus output and UDB data provides baseline comparison models between \Cyclus simulated
results and real world metrics.
