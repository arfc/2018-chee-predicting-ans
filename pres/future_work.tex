          To more accurately model isotopic concentrations in the \textsc{Cyclus} simulation, 
          these capabilities could be implemented in \textsc{Cyclus}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Simple: Toolkit that ties the reactor facility to a database of varying spent fuel recipes based on burnup 
              \item Complex: Toolkit that ties the reactor facility to the UDB database to give different spent fuel recipes based on the burnup of a specific spent fuel bundle
              \item Toolkit that gives the functionality of varying cycle time and refuel duration values 
          \end{itemize}
