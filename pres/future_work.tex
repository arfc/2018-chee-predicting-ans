          To more accurately model isotopic concentrations in the \textsc{Cyclus} simulation, 
          these capabilities could be implemented in \textsc{Cyclus}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Reactor facility that is tied to a database of varying spent fuel recipes based on burnup + Toolkit that gives the functionality of varying cycle time and refuel duration values 
              \item Reactor facility that is tied to the Unified database to give different spent fuel recipes based on the burnup of a specific spent fuel bundle
          \end{itemize}
