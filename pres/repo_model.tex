          Long Term Goal: Run simulations to determine how fuel allocation strategies impacts the mass loading of a nuclear waste repository in different host geologies. 
          \\

          Waste package thermal evolution depends on the \textbf{decay heat contribution from each isotope} in the spent fuel. 
          \\
          
          Therefore, to \textbf{correctly simulate loading of a nuclear waste repository based on thermal constraints} in \textsc{Cyclus}, the simulation must first give isotopic compositions and spent fuel masses that \textbf{closely replicate reality}.
