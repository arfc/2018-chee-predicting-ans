  \frametitle{Conclusion}
        These results demonstrate that the spent fuel mass and isotopic
        composition calculated by the Cyclus simulation for
        the US nuclear fuel cycle follow \textbf{similar trends} as the real
        world metrics.
        \\
        
        Deviations from the real world metric can be explained by issues with 
        the reactor facility in the \textsc{Cyclus} model: 
        \begin{itemize}
                \item only accepting integer month values for
                cycle and refueling durations
                \item single spent fuel recipe 
        \end{itemize}
