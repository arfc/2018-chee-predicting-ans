  \frametitle{Conclusion}
        These results demonstrate that the spent fuel mass calculated by the Cyclus simulation for
        the US nuclear fuel cycle follow \textbf{similar trends} as the real
        world metrics.
        However, there are significant mass differences in the important isotopes that contribute to decay heat. 
        \\
        
        Deviations from the real world metric can be explained by issues with 
        the reactor facility in the \textsc{Cyclus} model: 
        \begin{itemize}
                \item only accepting constant values for
                cycle and refueling durations
                \item single spent fuel recipe 
        \end{itemize}
