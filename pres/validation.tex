    \frametitle{Motivation for conducting the Validation}
    The main constraint for loading of a waste repository is the \textbf{thermal constraint} set by the material properties of the repository. 
    \\
    
    Waste package thermal evolution depends on the \textbf{decay heat contribution from each isotope} in the spent fuel. 
    \\
    
    Therefore, to \textbf{correctly simulate loading of a nuclear waste repository based on thermal constraints} in \textsc{Cyclus}, the simulation must first give isotopic compositions and spent fuel masses that \textbf{closely replicate reality}.
