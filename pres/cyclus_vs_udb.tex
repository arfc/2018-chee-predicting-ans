    \frametitle{Comparison of Cyclus Simulation against Unified Database}
    The total spent fuel mass and specific isotopic compositions from the \textsc{Cyclus} 
        simulation and Unified Database were \textbf{compared}. 
        \\ 
        
    Unified Database contains \textbf{commercial SNF information} from 1968 through 2013 such as 
        discharged fuel assembly data per reactor, specific isotopic concentrations and 
        decay heat for each assembly along with its discharge date \cite{peterson_unf_2017}.
