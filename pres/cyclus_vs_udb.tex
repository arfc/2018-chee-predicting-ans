    \frametitle{Comparison of Cyclus Simulation against UDB database}
        UDB database contains commercial SNF information from 1968 through 2013 such as 
        discharged fuel assembly data per reactor, specific isotopic concentrations and 
        decay heat for each assembly along with its discharge date \cite{peterson_unf_2017}. 
        \\ 
        
        The total spent fuel mass and specific isotopic compositions from the \textsc{Cyclus} 
        simulation and UDB database were compared.
